Unofficial thesis template, Department of Information Processing Science, University of Oulu.

Original by Teemu Rytilahti (tex/tol-orig.sty), another version (tex/tol.sty) with modifications by Juho Myllylahti.

The modified version requires fonts: Linux Libertine ( http://www.linuxlibertine.org/ ) and Helvetica Neue.

These files should help you get started, but naturally it would be nice, if someone came up with a "real" template at some point.
